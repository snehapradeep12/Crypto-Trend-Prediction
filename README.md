understand interdependence, stationarity, and optimal lags among the series. 

b) Performed a comparative study of univariate and multivariate analysis on Bitcoinâ€™s open, high, low, and close prices using ARIMA and LSTM models. Evaluated the performance and efficiency of these models for trend prediction.
